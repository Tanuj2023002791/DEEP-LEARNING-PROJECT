*COMPANY*: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*: J.TANUJ

*INTERN ID*: CT06DL1326

*DOMAIN*: DATA SCIENCE

*DURATION*: 6 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTHOSH

## 📈 Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **TensorFlow** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. The model is trained to recognize 10 different object categories from colored 32x32 images. The deliverables include a trained model, accuracy/loss visualizations, and sample prediction comparisons.
